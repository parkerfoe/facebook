# About
This repository contains the code that I used to answer the question: _Why is there so much negativity on Facebook comments about politics?_ This question is answered using R and SQLite in four parts: (A) Initial cleaning of the Facebook data, (B) a descriptive analysis of the cleaned dataset, (C) a comparative analysis using legislator information data extracted from [EveryPolitician](https://everypolitician.org/) and (D) testing my hypothesis derived from the first three parts.

## Disclaimer
Because some of the datasets and information are not public, those parts have been excluded from the repository
